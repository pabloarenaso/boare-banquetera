# Directives

This directory contains Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the agent.
Each directive should define:
- **Goal**: What is the purpose of this SOP?
- **Inputs**: What data or documents are required?
- **Tools**: Which scripts in `execution/` should be used?
- **Outputs**: What should the final result look like?
- **Edge Cases**: How to handle common errors or constraints.

Directives are living documents. Update them as you learn.
